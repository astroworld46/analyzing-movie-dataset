Our aim in this project is to explore the movie dataset and find some movies with high ratings. Your friend has just begun with his vacations and wants you to suggest some good movies for him to watch.
Since I have just learned Python, I decided to use your Python skills to analyze a movie dataset and explore the ratings of the movies. In my dataset, Dataset has the details of the movies in more than 50 languages, but your friend is interested only in watching English movies. Thus, our goal is to analyze the data and suggest English movies with high-ratings to your friend.
